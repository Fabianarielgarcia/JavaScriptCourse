///FIRST-CLASS AND HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS
///JavaScript is a language that has first class functions which in technical terms means that functions are so-called first citizens. In practice, that means that functions are simply treated as values. Since functions are values, there is a bunch of interesting things that we can do with them, like storing them in variables or objects properties, passing functions as arguments in other functions or return a function from another function. As functions are objects, there are also methods that we can call on functions.

///we do not call the book function ourselves. Instead, we called the call method and it's then this call method, which will call the book function with the this keyword set to Lapa. So whatever we pass has the first argument of the call method. This allows us to manually and explicitly set the this keyword of any function that we want to call. Then all the arguments after the firstone are simply the arguments of the original function.

///The bind method does not immediately call the function. Instead it returns a new function where the this keyword is bound. So it's set to whatever value we pass into bind.
///Let's suppose that we need to use the book function for Lapa all the time

Coding Challenge #1
Let's build a simple poll app!
A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an
array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter
'poll' object below.
Your tasks:
1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The
method does 2 things:
1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the
selected option. The prompt should look like this:
What is your favourite programming language?
0: JavaScript
1: Python
2: Rust
3: C++
(Write option number)
1.2. Based on the input number, update the 'answers' array property. For
example, if the option is 3, increase the value at position 3 of the array by
1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes
sense (e.g. answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The
method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string'
or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using
console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a
string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1".
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each
'registerNewAnswer' method call.
5. Bonus: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test
data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do not put the arrays in the poll
object! So what should the this keyword look like in this situation?
