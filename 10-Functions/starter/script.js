///JavaScript is a language that has first class functions which in technical terms means that functions are so-called first citizens. In practice, that means that functions are simply treated as values.

As functions are objects, there are also methods that we can call on functions.

Coding Challenge #1
Let's build a simple poll app!
A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an
array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter
'poll' object below.
Your tasks:
1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The
method does 2 things:
1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the
selected option. The prompt should look like this:
What is your favourite programming language?
0: JavaScript
1: Python
2: Rust
3: C++
(Write option number)
1.2. Based on the input number, update the 'answers' array property. For
example, if the option is 3, increase the value at position 3 of the array by
1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes
sense (e.g. answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The
method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string'
or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using
console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a
string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1".
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each
'registerNewAnswer' method call.
5. Bonus: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test
data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do not put the arrays in the poll
object! So what should the this keyword look like in this situation?
The Complete JavaScript Course 21
Test data for bonus:
Â§ Data 1: [5, 2, 3]
Â§ Data 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]
Hints: Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last section ðŸ˜‰

///CLOSURES
/// A clousere is not a feature that we explicity use, so we do not create closures manually, it happens automatically in certain situations, we just need to recognize those situations

let passengerCount = 0;
const secureBooking = function () {
  let passengerCount = 0;

  return function () {
    passengerCount++;
    console.log(`${passengerCount} passengers`);
  };
};

const booker = secureBooking(); ///this booker function is just a function that exists out here in the global enviroment or in the global scope. And the enviroment in which the function was created (secureBooking function) is no longer active. It is in fact gone. But still the booker function somehow continues to have access to the variables that were present at the time that the function was created, in particular, the passengerCount variable. So that is exactly what closure does. A closure makes a function remember all the varianles that existed at the function's birthplae essentially (the function that is returned at the secureBooking function remembers everything at its birthplace, by the time it was created). The secret of closure is this: ANY FUNCTION ALWAYS HAS ACCESS TO THE VARIABLE ENVIROMENT OF THE EXECUTION CONTEXT IN WHICH THE FUNCTION WAS CREATED. In the case of booker, this function was created, it was born in the execution context of secureBooking(), which was popped off the stack previously. So, therefor the booker function will get access to this variable environment which contains the passengerCount variable, and this is how the function will be able to read and manioulate the passengerCount variable. So it's this conection that we call closure. The closure is then basically this variable (passengerCount) environment attached to the function, exactly as it was at the time and place that the function was created.
///The closure basically has priority over the scope chain, because if we do have another variable also called passengerCount in the global scope, JavaScript will look first at the variable in the closure for over the one in the global scope

booker();
booker();
booker();
console.dir(booker);

Lets see what happens to the n and the perGroup variables that are in the boardPassengers() function. Take into account that the callback function (setTimeout) was executed completely independently from the board passenger function. still, the callback function was able to use all the variables that were in the variable environment in which was created ("n" and "perGroup")
