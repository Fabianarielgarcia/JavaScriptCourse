/***We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends ðŸ˜…)!
Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game ('game' variable on
next page). In this challenge we're gonna work with that data.
Your tasks:
1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and
'players2')
2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field
players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the
goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10
field players
3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22
players)
4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a
new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus
'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called
'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player
names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the
number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which
team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary
operator.
Test data for 6.: First, use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'.
Then, call the function again with players from game.scored

Coding Challenge #2
Let's continue with our football betting app! Keep using the 'game' variable from
before.
Your tasks:
1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console,
along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We already
studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly like this:
Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
Odd of draw: 3.25
Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them
(except for "draw"). Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have the
same property names ðŸ˜‰
4. Bonus: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the
players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this
game, it will look like this:
{
Gnarby: 1,
Hummels: 1,
Lewandowski: 2
}

///First decition: Do we need a simple list of values? If so, we are going to use an array or a set. On the oder hand, if we need key value pairs, then we need an object or a map. With a key values pair, we have a way of discribing the values, so by using the key. On the other hand, in a list like an array or a set, we simply have the values without any description.
///ARRAY VS SET: We use arrays whenever we need to store values in order and when these values might contain duplicates. Also, we dhould always use arrays when we need to manipulate data becasuse there are a ton of useful array methods. Sets should be used when we are working with unique values. Besides that, we should use sets when high performance is really important, because operations like searching for an item or deleting an item from a set can be up to 10 times faster in sets than in arrays

///OBJECTS VS MAPS:Maps are way better suited for simple key value stores because thet offer better perfrmance in fact. Also map keys can have any data type, are easy to iterate amd it's easy to compute the size of a map. The biggest advantage of objects is probably how easy it is to write them and to access data by simply using the dot or the brackets operator. We should use maps when we simply need to map keys to values and also when we need keys that are not strings. Then, if we need functions as values, then we should absolutely use an object for that
